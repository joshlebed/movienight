# agent notes for movienight

Cross-cutting infra docs (network, hosts, dev workflow, safety rails) live in
the sibling [`homelab`](https://github.com/joshlebed/homelab) repo.
If `~/code/homelab` (or `/home/joshlebed/code/homelab` on
mediaserver) doesn't exist, clone it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:joshlebed/homelab.git ../homelab
```

This project is also generally distributable — most of the README applies to
anyone running it. Homelab-specific deployment notes are below.

## deployed on

`mediaserver`. Two cron jobs, both idempotent:

- **Daily 7 AM** (`make install-cron`) — full backup: Letterboxd scrape, local
  scan, report generation. `cron_backup.sh`. Logs to `cron.log`. After the
  data-repo commit, `scripts/post_discord_digest.py` posts a per-user
  watchlist-additions embed to Discord (same webhook media-stack uses;
  read from `media-stack/.env`). Best-effort — failure doesn't fail the
  cron. No-op on days with zero additions.
- **Every 5 min** (`make install-refresh-cron`) — picks up the qBit
  torrent-finished hook flag at
  `/home/joshlebed/code/qbittorrent-vpn/config/movienight-refresh-pending`. If
  present, runs `snapshot + unwatched` (no Letterboxd scrape) and clears the
  flag. `cron_refresh_on_flag.sh`. Logs to `cron-refresh.log`.

Reports land in `data/reports/` and are read by humans (no downstream
automation depends on them).

The two jobs share a flock (`/tmp/movienight-refresh.lock`) so they can't
race on writes to `data/cache/media_library.json` or the report files. The
poller skips if the daily run holds the lock; the daily run waits up to 600s
for the poller. Setup recipe + verification:
`homelab/docs/cookbook.md` under "wire qBittorrent → movienight
refresh".

## data directory

`data/` is gitignored on purpose — it's intended to be its own private git repo
for backup/version-history purposes. On mediaserver, check whether `data/.git`
exists and what its remote is before assuming a fresh setup. Do not commit
anything inside `data/` to this repo.

## key gotchas

1. **Library paths are mediaserver-specific.** `data/config.json` references
   `media_directories` paths that are valid on mediaserver only. Don't propagate
   those paths into code or docs — they're intentionally per-deployment.

2. **Letterboxd scraper has a 6-month cache** by default (`make backup`). Use
   `make backup-force` to bypass during development or after upstream Letterboxd
   changes.

3. **The cron job depends on `make` and `uv` being on the cron PATH.** If the
   daily run starts failing silently, check `crontab -l` and confirm `uv`
   resolves under `/bin/sh`.

4. **No production-critical impact** if this fails — reports just get stale.
   Lower-stakes than the Pi/HA/QLC services.

## development

- `make setup` — interactive wizard (config + optional data-repo init)
- `make backup` — full backup, uses cache
- `make backup-force` — bypass cache
- `make install-cron` / `make uninstall-cron` — manage the cron entry
  (idempotent)
- `make install-dev` / `make lint` / `make format` — dev tooling
